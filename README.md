# Snakey
Simple snake game to practice F# and functional programming.


paket and fmake are not used in this project.


Game engine is seperated so it can be used in different UIs (e.g., console and web)

## Download The Game
There is only console implementation for multiple platforms.  
Releases are **NOT** dependent on a runtime, so just download the zip for your os from the links below,  
and then run SnakeyConsole[.exe] and it should be working.
